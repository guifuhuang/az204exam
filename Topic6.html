        <h2>LabelMaker Application</h2>
        <p>Coho Winery produces, bottles, and distributes a variety of wines globally. You are a developer implementing highly scalable and resilient applications to support online order processing by using Azure solutions.</p>
        <p>The LabelMaker application prints labels for wine bottles. The application sends data to several printers and consists of five modules that run independently on virtual machines (VMs). Coho Winery plans to move the application to Azure and continue to support label creation.</p>
        <p>External partners send data to the LabelMaker application to include artwork and text for custom label designs.</p>

                <li>Changes to the Order data must reflect immediately across all partitions. All reads must fetch the most recent writes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="requirements">
            <h3>Security Requirements</h3>

                <li>External partners must use their own credentials and authenticate with their organizationâ€™s identity management solution.</li>
                <li>External partner logins must be audited monthly by a user account administrator for compliance.</li>

            <h3>LabelMaker App Requirements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use Azure Monitor Container Health to monitor performance of workloads deployed to Kubernetes environments hosted on AKS.</li>
                <li>Use Azure Container Registry to publish images supporting AKS deployment.</li>

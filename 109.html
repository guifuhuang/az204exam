        <h2>QUESTION NO: 109</h2>
        <p><em>Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.</em></p>
        <p><em>After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.</em></p>
        
        <p>You are developing an Azure solution to collect point-of-sale (POS) device data from 2,000 stores located throughout the world. A single device can produce 2 megabytes (MB) of data every 24 hours. Each store location has one to five devices that send data.</p>
        <p>You must store the device data in Azure Blob storage. Device data must be correlated based on a device identifier. Additional stores are expected to open in the future.</p>
        <p>You need to implement a solution to receive the device data.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Provision an Azure Notification Hub. Register all devices with the hub.</p>
        <p>Does the solution meet the goal?</p>

        <div id="answer" class="answer">
            <h3>正确答案: B. No</h3>
            <p><strong>说明:</strong></p>
            <p>Instead use an Azure Service Bus, which is used for order processing and financial transactions.</p>
            <p>Azure Notification Hub is designed for push notifications to mobile devices, not for collecting and processing POS device data. The correct solution would be to use Azure Service Bus which is better suited for order processing and financial transactions.</p>
